# sept-portfolio

This is a web based porfolio. As I progress through this course, and after, this portfolio will continuously evolve. 

My main goal here was to make a portfolio without the using bootstrap as a crutch. While bootstrap is fairly simple and quick to implement, the point here is to exhibit understanding of basic html with css markup and styling. 

some stretch goals that will be implemented as I progress are:
-refined styling and overall theme
-perhaps simplifying to just one or two pages instead of 3
-more examples of my work showcasing a larger scope of my skills
